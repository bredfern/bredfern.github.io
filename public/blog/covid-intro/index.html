  The Start of Covid
</h2>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2020-03-15</strong></p>
<p>Having been thrown out of work found myself home watching that very stable genius downplay the disaster pretnding somehow positive thinking alone could work by a miracle to disperse the plaugue.</p>
<p>Its possible it is an exaggerated threat or its possible its not until it hits its a guessing game of terror.</p>
<p>The silence in the streets is a testament to how little people trust the powers that be. The stores empty out but people will have to keep showing up for work.</p>
<p>While schools have been closed there has been no order to work remote, only some companies such as Google and Amazon have asked IT staff to work remote.</p>
<p>However other staff in other companies cannot do their work remote it has to be done onsite.</p>
<p>Hopefully the news is being at least somewhat truthful and most working people are not at risk.</p>
<p>Ultimately most business isn’t willing to lose 2 weeks to prevent mass illness. However you may see labor walkouts if you see deaths from this and it turns out to be wors than the news had promised.</p>
<p>You see people clearing out the entire inventory at markets if things get too bad it won’t be safe to go to the market.</p>
<p>The we hear Genesis P-orridge passed away and wondering whether its related, certainly people currently battling cancer would be prone to any illness.</p>
<p>But more on Genesis for that art’s own tribute.</p>
