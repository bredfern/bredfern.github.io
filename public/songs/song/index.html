<p>Staying in place is easy for a writer, its our natural inclination not to go out.</p>
<p>Its a strange world where suddenly Howard Hughs is a major role model but its a real thing.</p>
<p>But more about that in a music review.</p>
<p>For now we sit here waiting to hear of my dad’s passing, my mom completely torutured but what can one do?</p>
<p>We never know how long we have here, my friend lost his son and nephew to a car accident they were only 14. In many ways we make this place a lot more dangerous than it has to be in order for a few to benefit.</p>
<p>Here we can hardly stand a medical emergency yet the powers that be still seek war and confrontation. When can we have peace and cooperation with a focus on happiness, kindness and compassion?</p>
<p>Now I just focus on two things, what can I do to help and what can I learn while I have a lot of time to sit and read.</p>
<p>Try to clear my mind and make every action a meditation. While I’m completely freaked out of course but its important to acknowledge the fear give it its due but then put it away.</p>
<p>This is a great time to study online we have many great resources, I always like to point out khan academy because they’re free and open to anyone.</p>
