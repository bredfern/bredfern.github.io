      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
      I am an LA based web developer, I have worked with many large companies over the years as a web developer using various technologies, php, c#, python, nodejs.
      </p>
                <p>I am working on moving into cyber security, have my CC but am working to get my CSSIP.</p>
      <p>
	My first language was Java, I taught myself in order to use it to generate digital art and enable me to live stream on the web.
        Today java is still at the core of many live stream tools such as the Red5 server and many others.
      </p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
	Most recently I have been upgrading my skills working heavily on learning Rust, hopefully to get good enough to start making some major controbutions to free software projects written in Rust.
      </p>
      <p>
	In the past I wrote java for Disney and have a cool Imagineering pin from my time with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the pandemic I got into webrtc and worked on a number of webrtc programs.
      </p>
      <p>
	I have worked with many databases over the years, MS SQL Server, Oracle, Mysql, Postgresql, Mongodb, and now I am digging into sqlite hoping to work on the project to rewrite sqlite in Rust.

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>
        I first got into music playing with my college band, LHDJ. In the late 90s I was playing guitar for jazz trumpet and composer Wadada Leo Smith's Nda Kulture ensemble.
      </p>
      <p>
	I use linux and open source software to make my music. However because its largely guitar based you might not know but I like to say so because Ardour is often much better than its competition. 
      </p>
      <p>
      You can hear my music on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@redfernguitar" target="new">youtube channel</a>.
      </p>
      <p>I also release music for download on <a href="https://brianredfern.bandcamo.com">Bandcamp</p>
