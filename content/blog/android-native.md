For the kind of app I want to create its a tension between whether I should go android native, try using flutter or use browser technology.

Looking at what a nightmare it is to keep up with api changes it may not be worth it.

Its hard to tell whether the web will be killed, if apps will be killed and the browser killed and computing made illegal.
