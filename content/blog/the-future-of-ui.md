Well, is there a future for UI? Ui Design assumes that we are designing for humans. While CEOs speak in baited breath about the wonders of AI, even though some demos are exaggerated the technology is already good enough to make a major impact.

Regardless I'm making software meant for human use until humans are eliminated. At that point I won't care.

One side wants ww3, the other wants a civil war, while the tech bros are eliminating any economic need for most human beings.
