As a member of what the Boomers sneeringly called "genX" I am used to having my rights
violated, sometimes in the most vicious ways one could imagine.

But their handling of Ai really takes the cake. Here they were complaining and complaining
about the very real problem of global warming, only to have absolutely no discussion about
whether Ai is worth it given the tremendous cost we are seeing to both humans and the
environment.

Now in the face of the drive to nuclear war, the gloves come off and as we roast they
push forward with catastrophic choices, but in this supposed "democracy" we are not
asked our permission for anything. Rather than citizens we are being pushed into a
new begging class, where nothing you do in life is good enough for the power elite
to even allow you to live.

A world of absolute control and absolute sadism, driven 24/7 by artifical minds trained by
sadists and bigots.
