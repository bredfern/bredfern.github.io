Its been two years since the economy has been able to provide for humans in Southern California.

There's an assumption made that war is good for the economy - blow things up then pay your own companies to rebuild them.

I have heard Senators claim this war in Ukraine is a "great investment," as if they are discussing real estate rather tha fragile and innocent human lives to be wiped out for money for a few.

If we land in a nuclear war, what of this "investment" then?

War pulls all the money out of the economy and places it into the hands of a tiny few.
