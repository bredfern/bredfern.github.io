<h1>Welcome to my web site</h1>
<p>
I am a designer, developer and musician. I love 0 or near 0 dependency web development, Considered a dead artform in the brutal
drive to make everything use React. I know, web components are class based but when using a very minimal framework like lit even so they're a very powerful tool because of this. Often in react and vue people hardly ever use the component props and often use global state management instead.
</p>

<p>
Both react and vue are much slower than lit or than using just css3 and html. Often 90% of the web app can be done with html and css or sass and then the other 10% can be done with per page code.
</p>

<p>
All that being said, react has largely won the war in terms of the 3 way battle between angularjs, react and vue. Vue is not dead and nuxt version 3 is as awesome and powerful as next.js for react, but in the end because of its focus on backwards compatibility and because of the power and concision of jsx, react today has won.
</p>

<p>
Personally I have worked with all three but I prefer react simply because it has the most market share, however having spend 25 years on web development I still pride myself that my personal site comes in at only 16k.
</p>

<p>
This website itself is built with zola and doesn't use javascript, only css3 to show what can be done with fast loading pages and css with no need for javascript.
