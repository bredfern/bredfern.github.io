<h2>Welcome to my Site</h2>
<p>
I am a designer, developer and musician. I love 0 or near 0 dependency web development, Considered a dead artform in the brutal
drive to make everything use React. I know, web components are class based but when using a very minimal framework like lit even so they're a very powerful tool because of this. Often in react and vue people hardly ever use the component props and often use global state management instead.
</p>

<p>
Both react and vue are much slower than lit or than using just css3 and html. Often 90% of the web app can be done with html and css or sass and then the other 10% can be done with per page code.
</p>

<p>
All that being said, react has largely won the war in terms of the 3 way battle between angularjs, react and vue. Vue is not dead and nuxt version 3 is as awesome and powerful as next.js for react, but in the end because of its focus on backwards compatibility and because of the power and concision of jsx, react today has won.
</p>

<p>
While I am embarking on a new 0 dependency project the last project I did for a business I used react, tailwind css and nextjs and it turned out great and was delivered under time and under budget.
</p>

<p>
While web components do have some ecosphere its not as large as react. However I think lit + vite + typescript is a better fit for doing client heavy work like my new prject, a web based audio/video DAW like digital performer in the browser. For media application speed is super important, the thing with web components is they're not a framework they're a native browser api, it doesn't get any faster or more performant than a native browser api being called from pure client code.
</p>

<p>
This website itself is built with zola and doesn't use javascript, only css3 to show what can be done with fast loading pages and css with no need for javascript.
