<h2>Hi I'm Brian</h2>
<p>
    I am a senior web developer, and performer/composer of music. I started out
    way back in 1998 with the pre-ipo team at Geocities. I went into LAMP in the
    early 2000s and then moved into full stack Nodejs with Vue. Now I am working
    with Htmx and PHP, fulll circle back to LAMP but with modern tools.
