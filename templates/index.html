<h3>Hi I'm Brian</h3>
<p>I am a senior web developer. I started out way back in 1998 with the pre-ipo team at Geocities.
</p>
<p>
Currently I'm working on an advanced PWA project. You can find more of my projects in my <a href="https://github.com/bredfern">Github</a> profile.
</p>
<p>
When I am not coding I make music, see my <a href="https://brianredfern.bandcamp.com" target="new">Bandcamp page.</a>
