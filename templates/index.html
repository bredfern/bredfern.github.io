<h1>Welcome to my Site</h1>
<p>Hi there I am Brian, I play fretless along with fretted guitar, bass and oud. I also produce music with software but I like to keep things organic compared to most modern music.
</p>
<p>
Before AI and this downturn I was a web designer and SEO expert so unlike most sites, I use no external dependencies for this blog. I do use <a href="https://getzola;org" target="new">Zola</a>. I also work with plain js using the native browser apis like shadow dom and custom elements.
</p>
<p>
Right now I am working on my first commercial project for Android Native, an MPE midi cotroller for hardware and the desktop.
