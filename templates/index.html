<h1>Welcome to my Site</h1>

Hi there, my name is Brian, I have been making art since 1974, making music since 1986 and working with web/ui design, LAMP stacks, MERN stacks, Nextsjs, Python/Django/Postgres, linux and SEO since 1995. My first major job was in
1998 as a designer on the pro-IPO team at Geocities.

I had my first poem publshed in an academic journal when I was 15 years old. I got my MFA in writing in 1998. However I focus on poetry though today I am getting encouraged to work on long form.

I am also a jazz guitarist and play bass, oud, clarinet, soprano sax, flutes and percussion. I have performed live with different jazz and rock groups since 1988.
